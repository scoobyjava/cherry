"""
Script to automatically resolve Tabnine merge conflicts by keeping the newer code.
This script will look for Tabnine merge conflict markers and resolve them by:
1. For files with #+/- markers: Keep the lines with #+ and remove lines with #-
2. For files without these markers: Keep the code between >>>>>>> Tabnine and <<<<<<< Tabnine
