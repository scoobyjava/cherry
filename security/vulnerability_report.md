# Security Vulnerability Report

This report outlines security vulnerabilities identified in the Cherry project configuration files, listed in order of severity.

## Critical Severity

### 1. Hardcoded API Keys and Credentials

**Location**: `benchmark_config.json`

**Description**: The configuration file contains environment variable placeholders for sensitive credentials, but doesn't ensure these are properly set at runtime. If environment variables are not properly set, applications may default to hardcoded values or expose empty configuration entries.

**Impact**: Potential exposure of sensitive credentials if not properly handled at runtime.

**Recommendation**: 
- Implement validation to ensure all required environment variables are set before application startup
- Add fail-safe defaults that refuse to start with missing credentials
- Consider implementing a secrets validation routine

### 2. Insecure File Paths for Credentials

**Location**: `/secure/credentials/gcp-service-account.json` and other paths in `benchmark_config.json`

**Description**: The application references sensitive files in predictable locations that may be accessible to unauthorized users if file system permissions aren't correctly configured.

**Impact**: Potential unauthorized access to service account credentials and other sensitive files.

**Recommendation**:
- Use a dedicated secrets management solution rather than filesystem storage
- If filesystem storage is necessary, validate permissions on these directories at startup
- Consider encrypting sensitive files at rest

## High Severity

### 1. Excessive Permissions and Scope

**Location**: Multiple service configurations in `benchmark_config.json`

**Description**: The configuration appears to grant broad access to various services without explicitly limiting scope. For example, the GCP service account may have more permissions than needed.

**Impact**: Violation of principle of least privilege, increasing the blast radius in case of a compromise.

**Recommendation**:
- Define explicit permission scopes for each service
- Document the required permissions for each component
- Implement service account role limitations

### 2. Insufficient Rate Limiting

**Location**: OpenAI configuration in `benchmark_config.json`

**Description**: The rate limiting configuration (60 requests per minute) may be insufficient to prevent abuse or excessive spending.

**Impact**: Potential for abuse, denial of service, or unexpected billing.

**Recommendation**:
- Implement tiered rate limiting with alerts for unusual activity
- Add budget limits and circuit breakers
- Consider dynamic rate limiting based on usage patterns

## Medium Severity

### 1. Weak Backup Security

**Location**: Backup configurations for Pinecone and Postgres

**Description**: Backup configurations do not specify encryption requirements or access controls.

**Impact**: Backups could potentially be accessed by unauthorized parties, leading to data exposure.

**Recommendation**:
- Explicitly configure encryption for backups
- Implement access controls specific to backup storage
- Add regular backup validation and integrity checks

### 2. Missing TLS Configuration

**Location**: Various service connections in `benchmark_config.json`

**Description**: While SSL mode is required for Postgres, other services don't explicitly configure minimum TLS versions or cipher preferences.

**Impact**: Potential for downgrade attacks or use of deprecated encryption protocols.

**Recommendation**:
- Explicitly specify minimum TLS version (1.2 or higher)
- Define allowed cipher suites
- Configure certificate validation parameters

## Low Severity

### 1. Insufficient Logging and Monitoring

**Location**: Overall configuration

**Description**: The configuration lacks specific details about logging, monitoring, and alerting for security events.

**Impact**: Potential delays in detecting and responding to security incidents.

**Recommendation**:
- Add logging configuration for security-relevant events
- Configure alerts for suspicious activities
- Implement regular log review processes

### 2. Missing Timeout Configurations

**Location**: Various service definitions

**Description**: Some services have timeout configurations while others don't, creating inconsistency.

**Impact**: Services without proper timeout configurations may be vulnerable to denial of service or resource exhaustion.

**Recommendation**:
- Implement consistent timeout configurations across all services
- Configure appropriate retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Add circuit breakers for external dependencies

## Remediation Priority

1. Address all Critical findings immediately
2. Schedule High severity issues for the next sprint
3. Plan Medium severity issues for upcoming work
4. Address Low severity issues during regular maintenance

## Additional Recommendations

- Conduct regular security scanning against the codebase
- Implement security testing in the CI/CD pipeline
- Perform regular penetration testing of the deployed application
