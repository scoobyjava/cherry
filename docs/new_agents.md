# New Agents Proposal for Cherry Pre-Deployment

## 1. PreDeploymentValidatorAgent
- **Role:** Validate system configuration and environment readiness before deployment.
- **Tasks:** 
  - Check configuration files and dependency versions.
  - Run health checks on external integrations.
  - Simulate pre-flight tests to detect issues early.
- **High-Level Architecture:**
  - Integrate as a pre-step in the staging workflow.
  - Interface with system monitoring APIs and configuration management tools.
  - Report validation status to the central deployment controller.
- **KPIs:**
  - Validation success rate.
  - Average validation time.
  - Number of pre-deployment alerts raised.

## 2. ResourceOptimizationAgent
- **Role:** Monitor and optimize system resource allocation during pre-deployment.
- **Tasks:**
  - Continuously observe CPU, memory, and I/O metrics.
  - Provide recommendations or trigger automated adjustments.
  - Alert if resource usage deviates from expected baselines.
- **High-Level Architecture:**
  - Leverage existing resource metrics (e.g., via psutil).
  - Run in parallel with the staging deployment process.
  - Communicate with orchestration components to adjust resource allocation.
- **KPIs:**
  - Improvement in CPU and memory efficiency.
  - Reduction in resource-related warnings.
  - Frequency of successful optimization interventions.

## 3. PostDeploymentHealthAgent
- **Role:** Monitor the health of the system immediately after deployment.
- **Tasks:**
  - Continuously assess the stability of deployed services.
  - Collect error logs and performance metrics.
  - Provide real-time feedback and trigger automated mitigation if needed.
- **High-Level Architecture:**
  - Integrate with the existing logging framework and alerting system.
  - Interface with deployment reporting modules.
  - Operate as a background process post-deployment to ensure lasting system health.
- **KPIs:**
  - Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) after post-deployment issues.
  - Rate of error incidence.
  - Frequency and effectiveness of automated mitigations.
