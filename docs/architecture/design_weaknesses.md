# Architectural Design Weaknesses

This document outlines key architectural weaknesses identified in the Cherry project configuration and provides recommendations for addressing them.

## 1. Configuration Structure Issues

### 1.1 Tight Coupling to Infrastructure

**Problem:** Hardcoded infrastructure references (regions, paths, service names) create tight coupling between the application and its deployment environment.

```json
"environment": "us-west1-gcp",
"credentials_file": "/secure/credentials/gcp-service-account.json"
```

**Recommendation:** 
- Use environment variables for all environment-specific values
- Create environment-specific configuration overlays
- Implement a configuration abstraction layer between application and infrastructure

### 1.2 Inconsistent Configuration Hierarchy

**Problem:** Configuration objects have inconsistent depth and structure across services, making it difficult to standardize access patterns.

**Recommendation:**
- Establish standard configuration object patterns
- Limit nesting depth to 3-4 levels maximum
- Normalize configuration access paths across similar services

## 2. Separation of Concerns

### 2.1 Mixed Operational and Application Concerns

**Problem:** The configuration mixes operational concerns (backups, monitoring, high availability) with application configuration, creating unnecessary dependencies.

**Recommendation:**
- Separate configurations into distinct domains:
  - Application configuration
  - Infrastructure configuration
  - Operational configuration
  - Security configuration
- Use a layered configuration approach where these concerns can be managed independently

### 2.2 Cross-Cutting Concerns Duplication

**Problem:** Cross-cutting concerns like monitoring, security, and error handling are defined independently for each service, creating duplication and inconsistency.

**Recommendation:**
- Define cross-cutting concerns once and apply them consistently
- Implement a middleware/interceptor pattern for cross-cutting concerns
- Use configuration inheritance or composition for shared settings

## 3. Configuration Management

### 3.1 Lack of Schema Definition and Validation

**Problem:** No clear schema definition or validation rules exist for configuration values, risking runtime errors from misconfiguration.

**Recommendation:**
- Define JSON schema for configuration validation
- Implement configuration validation at startup
- Add explicit type definitions and constraints

### 3.2 Monolithic Configuration

**Problem:** The configuration is a monolithic structure that requires full loading even when only portions are needed.

**Recommendation:**
- Break configuration into modular components
- Implement lazy loading of configuration sections
- Create a hierarchical configuration that can be navigated and loaded selectively

## 4. Resilience and Security

### 4.1 Inconsistent Error Handling

**Problem:** Error handling, retry strategies, and resilience patterns vary across services.

**Recommendation:**
- Standardize error handling patterns
- Implement consistent retry policies
- Create centralized resilience strategies

### 4.2 Embedded Secrets Management

**Problem:** Secret management is embedded in the application configuration rather than being externalized.

**Recommendation:**
- Separate secrets management from configuration
- Implement a dedicated secrets abstraction layer
- Use a vault integration pattern instead of direct secret references

## 5. Service Integration

### 5.1 Missing Service Dependencies

**Problem:** Service configurations appear disconnected, with no clear definition of dependencies between services.

**Recommendation:**
- Document service dependencies explicitly
- Implement a service registry pattern
- Use a dependency injection approach for service composition

### 5.2 No Service Discovery

**Problem:** Services are directly referenced without a discovery mechanism, creating tight coupling.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement a service discovery pattern
- Use logical service names instead of direct addressing
- Add service health checks and circuit breakers

## Implementation Plan

To address these weaknesses, we recommend:

1. Create a configuration management framework that enforces standardized patterns
2. Implement a layered configuration approach that separates concerns
3. Develop schema-based validation for all configuration objects
4. Refactor to use a service registry and dependency injection pattern
5. Implement centralized cross-cutting concerns

This will improve maintainability, reduce coupling, and create a more resilient architecture.
