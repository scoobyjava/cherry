# Configuration Architecture Migration Plan

This document outlines a phased approach to address the architectural weaknesses in Cherry's configuration system.

## Phase 1: Analysis and Planning (2 weeks)

1. **Complete Configuration Audit**
   - Document all configuration values across the system
   - Identify all environment-specific values
   - Map service dependencies and relationships

2. **Define Configuration Schemas**
   - Create JSON schemas for all configuration objects
   - Define validation rules and constraints
   - Document expected types and formats

3. **Design New Architecture**
   - Finalize layered configuration design
   - Design configuration loading mechanism
   - Plan service registry and dependency injection approach

## Phase 2: Framework Development (4 weeks)

1. **Create Configuration Management Framework**
   - Develop configuration loading and validation
   - Implement schema validation
   - Create configuration access patterns (with typing)

2. **Build Service Registry**
   - Develop service registration mechanism
   - Implement dependency resolution
   - Create service lifecycle management

3. **Develop Cross-Cutting Concerns**
   - Create standardized retry mechanisms
   - Implement connection pooling abstraction
   - Develop monitoring instrumentation

## Phase 3: Incremental Migration (6 weeks)

1. **Migrate Core Services**
   - Start with non-critical services
   - Implement new configuration structure
   - Update service initialization to use new framework

2. **Migrate Integration Points**
   - Refactor external service connections
   - Implement resilience patterns
   - Apply monitoring instrumentation

3. **Migrate Application Configuration**
   - Update application startup
   - Implement configuration validation
   - Apply dependency injection

## Phase 4: Validation and Optimization (2 weeks)

1. **Perform Integration Testing**
   - Verify all services work with new configuration
   - Test resilience mechanisms
   - Validate monitoring instrumentation

2. **Optimize Performance**
   - Tune connection pooling
   - Optimize configuration loading
   - Profile service initialization

3. **Documentation and Knowledge Transfer**
   - Update developer documentation
   - Conduct knowledge transfer sessions
   - Create examples for new service integration

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Maintain support for legacy configuration during migration
   - Create adapters between old and new patterns
   - Use feature flags to enable new architecture incrementally

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Comprehensive unit tests for configuration framework
   - Integration tests for each migrated service
   - Chaos testing for resilience mechanisms

3. **Rollback Plan**
   - Deploy with canary approach
   - Maintain ability to switch between architectures
   - Document rollback procedures for each service

## Success Criteria

1. All services configured using new architecture
2. Configuration validation preventing misconfiguration
3. Resilience mechanisms consistently applied
4. Clear separation of application, infrastructure, and operational concerns
5. Reduced configuration duplication
6. Improved developer experience when configuring services
