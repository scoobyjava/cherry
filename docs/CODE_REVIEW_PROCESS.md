# Cherry AI Code Review Process

## Phase 1: Automated Analysis

1. Run the code review script: `./scripts/code_review.sh`
2. Review the output files in the `code_review_results` directory
3. Address critical issues identified by automated tools

## Phase 2: Architecture Review

1. Create a visual representation of the system architecture
2. Identify key components and their interactions
3. Evaluate against architectural principles:
   - Modularity
   - Separation of concerns
   - Single responsibility
   - Dependency management
4. Document architectural findings and recommendations

## Phase 3: Component-by-Component Review

For each major component:

1. **Backend Services**

   - Review API design and implementation
   - Check error handling and validation
   - Evaluate database interactions
   - Assess security measures

2. **AI/ML Components**

   - Review model integration
   - Check prompt engineering
   - Evaluate response handling
   - Assess performance optimization

3. **Frontend Components**

   - Review UI/UX implementation
   - Check state management
   - Evaluate component structure
   - Assess accessibility

4. **Infrastructure and DevOps**
   - Review deployment configuration
   - Check CI/CD pipelines
   - Evaluate monitoring setup
   - Assess scaling strategy

## Phase 4: Cross-Cutting Concerns

1. **Security**

   - Authentication and authorization
   - Data protection
   - Input validation
   - Secret management

2. **Performance**

   - Response times
   - Resource utilization
   - Caching strategies
   - Optimization opportunities

3. **Testing**

   - Test coverage
   - Test quality
   - Test automation
   - Test environments

4. **Documentation**
   - Code documentation
   - API documentation
   - User documentation
   - Operational documentation

## Phase 5: Synthesis and Recommendations

1. Compile findings from all review phases
2. Prioritize issues based on:
   - Security impact
   - Performance impact
   - Maintainability impact
   - User experience impact
3. Create actionable recommendations
4. Develop implementation plan with timelines

## Phase 6: Implementation and Verification

1. Address high-priority issues
2. Verify fixes with appropriate testing
3. Document changes and improvements
4. Update architecture and design documentation
